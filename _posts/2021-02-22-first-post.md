Welcome to my blog, backlog buster. I want to truly thank you for taking the time to visit and listen to my various ramblings. My name is Stephen Packer and I am a junior software engineer in the Edmonton (AB) start up scene. In my free time I like to work on coding side projects, play video games and watch and play sports. 

The Backlog Busting blog is mainly focused around my passison for video games. I am going to share with you the reader, my thoughts, feelings and critiques as I journey through my ever growing backlog. To keep things interesting I will sprinkle in any programming adventures I go on and share my learnings and progress.

I hope you enjoy and lets get busting!
